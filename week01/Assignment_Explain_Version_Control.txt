Version control is a system for managing and recording changes made to a project over time. This means that every modification or change is documented, which makes it easier to identify errors, revert undesired changes and understand the evolution of the project. One of the advantages is the improvement of teamwork, as any developer can work on separate branches and then merge their parts without overwriting the work of other colleagues.  For example a team can split the work so that one of them can develop a fix for a bug while the other can develop a new feature, then both can merge their parts into the main project with a review and merge process. A common command is “git commit -m ‘Update description’”, you can save as a screenshot of the project status at that time. This can help to have a detailed history of all changes, which helps to have good quality software.
